# Filter

Filter consists of a Form that displays the filtering options for the particular entity.

The Filter form is:

- generated based on the entity schema
- fully pluggable, using named form field mappings if present, defaulting to generic mappings.

You can create and plug-in your own component mappings (or generators) as needed
